I will provide a job description and my work information in JSON format.
Your task is to analyze and match my information with the job's requirements.
Then, you need to create the best possible cover letter to align my information with the job description and company description.

Here is job description:
<JD_TEXT>

Here is my resume content:
<CV_TEXT>

Provide output in JSON format like following:
{
    "coverletter": "cover letter content"
}

I want to convert the output directly to JSON hence, the results should contain valid JSON only, without any delimiter or characters making invalid JSON format.
